<h1>CV Application</h1>

This project is part of <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application" target = "_blank">The Odin Project Curriculum (TOP)</a>, which is the first instance in which students use React.js. The user inputs data for form components on the left side, and the right side renders the inputs using the virtual DOM to create a resume.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
Below I am going to write some features that I would want to implement if I came back to the future, and some of the struggles I had regarding implementation / what I would need to improve on in the future.
<br>
<br>
Features To Add:
<ul>
  <li>Button to download resume</li>
  <li>Education should be similar to work experience, where you can add multiple and decide what to show</li>
  <li>Change order of how the resume is displayed (some people prefer education on the top if they're a new graduate)</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Areas of Struggle / What I need to research and improve on for the next project:
<ul>
  <li>Github commits - I feel like my github commits are still messy because I'm trying to work on multiple features at once. When I finish a feature, I should commit that feature and move on to other things that need fixing.</li>
  <li>Deciding what needs to be a react component - I didn't have a clear idea of what components I had to make before I started coding (e.g. Work Experience and Education roughly should have the same styling)</li>
  <li>File organization - How I organized the files are okay for small projects, btu it would definitely be confusing the more files I add. I need to watch a video on this.</li>
  <li>Passing parameters in React - because of how I structured the files, I passed too many parameters to the work experience form. I could refactor it by putting the buttons inside the work experience form as children in the app.jsx file, but I need to watch/read more resources on this to prevent my code from being messy in the future.</li>
</ul>
